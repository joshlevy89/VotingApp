This Voting App allows users to view, create, and vote on polls.  The front-end is built using react,redux, webpack and various other libraries. The back-end is an express server.  Web socket communication is handled with SocketIO. A react boilerplate was used to get started (https://github.com/gaearon/react-hot-boilerplate).
